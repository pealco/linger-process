linger-process

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a set of classes for processing Linger reading-time data
into a more useful format to be used by R.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Features:
  * Makes expanding conditions into factors very easy.
  * The order in which columns are output is customizable.

Problems:
  * The columns header that is currently output does not correctly
    output the factor names. This means that in R you must use header=F
    in read.table (the default).

== SYNOPSIS:

  See example.rb for a usage example.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  * This was created using ruby 1.8.7, but anything >= 1.8.6 should work fine.

== INSTALL:

  * To "install" just copy linger-process.rb into your working directory and
    then "require" it in your analysis script. See example.rb for an example
    of such a script.
  
  * This will eventually be packaged as a gem.
